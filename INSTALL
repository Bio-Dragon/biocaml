Biocaml Installation Instructions

Install From Source
===================

Uncompress the source archive, go to the root of the package, then run

    omake configure [VAR=val]

Where VAR maybe:

- `PREFIX` and its value a path (like `/usr/`)
- `BUILD_APP` (`true` or `false`, requires the Flow library)
- `BUILD_TESTS` (`true` or `false`, requires the oUnit framework)

You may check the configuration with `omake print_conf`

Them, build:

    omake

and install:

    omake install

there, you maybe want to override some variables:

    omake install INSTALL_BINDIR=some/path


To compile documentation, do

    omake doc

To uninstall, do

    omake uninstall


You may also build the `TAGS` file (requires `otags`):

    omake TAGS

or run the test suite:

    omake test
